# 2.0.3
+ Re-added audio after fixing some issues.
+ Sorted dmca and dmca-free audio, and added a dmca-free toggle in the emote menu.<br>
In dmca-free mode, many songs will be muted, but some may be replaced by non-copyrighted versions.
+ Fixed issue with emote audio being heard (quietly) everywhere on the map.
+ Performing an emote with audio will always try to use the closest boombox to you now, instead of the closest boombox that was not playing audio. This helps when intending to perform audio on a specific boombox instead of another one that someone else had.
+ Re-added California Girls
+ Fixed issue with held item not moving with you during emotes.
+ Fixed another potential issue with favorited emotes disappearing.
+ For various emotes in the emote store, you may need to type the whole emote name if the name might conflict with an existing terminal command so the terminal command will not be blocked.
+ Fixed issue with controllers not being able to perform emotes.
# 2.0.2
+ Didn't mean to remove Jug Band in 2.0.1, oops.
# 2.0.1
+ Temporarily removing audio to fix some issues. Will reupload in a few days when I have free time.
# 2.0.0
+ Added emote audio! These will automatically play on a nearby boombox that's not currently playing audio from an emote.
+ Added emotes with props!
+ Some emotes, such as those with musical instruments will not need a boombox in order to play audio.
+ The Jug band emote has been added, which is 1 emote, but includes 4 emotes with their own musical instrument, and up to 4 players can sync with the emote to perform a different instrument. Preview: https://youtu.be/tWsCQk6ODEk<br>
More emotes like this may come in the future.
+ Added settings in the emote menu to mute and adjust emote audio volume, as well as added config options for more customization.
+ Fixed keybind display name issues. (hopefully for good)
+ Fixed compat with mods who manipulate the player's bones and cannot see emotes.
+ Please report any bugs with this update to me on the github page, thank you!
+ Re-added California Gurls
# 1.9.5
+ Fixed issue where Masked Enemies that die while emoting continue emoting.
+ Re-added California Gurls. Again. Why does it keep getting removed???
+ Added more emotes!
+ Re-compressed animations. Sorry for the large file sizes the past few updates!
+ It seems that the animation preview in the emote menu doesn't work for the very first emote now, but once you preview another one, it starts to behave itself. Will fix later.
# 1.9.4
+ Replaced the player's avatar to increase animation quality. This will help with most animations that rely on hand precision. Will be tweaking again soon.
+ Some emotes with a start and loop animation clip might not transition well. Or maybe it's just the windmill emote. I will fix this soon.
+ Fixed issue while syncing with a player's emote where your emote will always start from the beginning.
+ Finally fixed the issue with Corporate Restructure causing the emote camera to appear outside the ship. (spoiler, it was because their mod threw an error that prevented the game's player spawn animation method to run, which I hook onto)
+ Fixed the issue with not being able to scroll backwards on the emote menu pages when reversing the scroll direction in the config.
+ Removed false alarm errors about bones not being mapped. (should have been warnings instead, but removed anyways)
+ Not gonna lie, I feel like I broke something, but I can't find anything wrong... Sus. Just post any issues on the github please :)
# 1.9.3
+ Did a goof and accidentally pushed some testing files into 1.9.2 that caused emotes to not show, thus showing the underlying default dance emote.
# 1.9.2
+ Quickfix for LCVR compat mistake where all players running LCVR could not emote, even if VR mode was disabled.
# 1.9.1
+ Fixed issue with update 1.9.0 breaking the scrolling in game. Whoops!
+ Readded the GetCurrentlyPlayingEmote method to the PlayerPatcher temporarily so the ModelReplacementAPI mod reference for my mod won't be broken.
+ Readded the California Girl emote. I did not mean to remove it :(
+ Removed complementary emotes from the common emotes category. They should only appear in the complementary emotes loadout in the radial menu now.
+ Added checks for cases where multiples of the same emote were being imported in. Probably my fault if this happens, but the mod should continue fine, though.
+ Upon opening the emote menu for the first time each session, the favorites loadout will be defaulted if you currently have unlocked favorited emotes.
# 1.9.0
+ Restructured most of the code revolving around animations, animators, animator controllers, etc.
+ Animations from this mod now affect a separate animator and skeleton, and translates the animations to the actual player's rig realtime. (Thanks Nunchuck and Unsaved Trash from the Lethal Emotes API mod for the tips!)<br>
Animations will now be much more compatible with other mods that may use/edit the players' animator/animator controller.
+ This mod no longer needs to disable/enable the player's animation rigging components in order to correctly animate the arms and legs. This will full remove the previous issue with legs/arms often deforming after performing emotes.
+ Fixed issue with cosmetics that have lights rendering the lights in the first person layer.
+ Fixed some issues with the terminal thinking they're trying to buy an emote when they're trying to go to the company building.
+ Added more complementary emotes.
+ Added more emotes in general. (probably removed some, I don't remember)
+ Probably broke a lot of compatibility with mods that reference classes and methods from this mod, such as LethalCompanyVR and ModelReplacementAPI.
+ Now automatically disables emoting for self when LCVR is enabled. LCVR should be good to remove their compat patches with this mod, and I have notified them of this.
+ Now implements custom networking methods to send/receive emote updates for players/masked players instead of relying on the in-game functions, which is still surprising that it worked at all.<br>
These new methods should be much more reliable and future proof.
+ Various bugs and fixes that I can't even remember.
+ Probably broke some stuff, so please report bugs to me about this udpate!
# 1.8.6
+ Tweaked terminal commands to be more accurate and smart when determining if someone is attempting to purchase an emote.
+ Added extra check when performing an emote just in case another mod changed the layer or visibility of the player's main body.

+ Fixed issue when the ShareEverything setting in the config is disabled and a player purchases an emote, the emote credits shouldn't be deducted from each player anymore.
+ Some UI tweaks.
+ Possible fix for the issue when players cancel an emote, other players emotes "break".
# 1.7.10
+ Fixed issue with dress girl showing up in the third person emote camera when she's not supposed to be visible.
+ Attempted fix for lag caused by code when MoreCompany is not enabled. (Thanks legoandmars!)
+ Rotating while emote can now be set to toggle in the config.
+ Audio is now based off of the third person emote camera while emoting.
# 1.7.9
+ Added more compat checks for More_Emotes. You should now be unable to emote while performing an emote from More_Emotes. (maybe even from other mods that add emotes)
+ The third person emote camera should now reset and swap back to the main camera if you die.
+ Attempted to fix some issues with translation mods causing issues when checking for certain values in the terminal. (hopefully fixed)

+ Players joining after a player DC'd while emoting <i>should</i> not have a broken animation rig anymore for other players.
+ Added a few more emotes!

(hopefully fixed the main issues from the previous patch)

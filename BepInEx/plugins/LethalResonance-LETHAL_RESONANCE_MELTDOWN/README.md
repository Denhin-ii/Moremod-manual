<b>Official Lethal Resonance Fork for facility Meltdown! If you like the work please hit the thumbs up above!</b>

## OVERVIEW

Dive into our captivating, high stakes rendition of the Facility Meltdown alarm audio! Experience your final 2 minutes our way and enjoy the anxiety that the sound true impending doom brings. If you like our work give us a thumbs up to support us!

There are no memes or music in this fork. The goal of this fork is to be as focused on horror, immersion, hearing the echos/reverb in the facility halls, to be able to feel the audio "roll off of things", BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY to increase the tension of this high stakes event.

## BEST EXPERIENCED WITH OUR MAIN SOUND OVERHAUL

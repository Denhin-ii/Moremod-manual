# ReservedUtilitySlot
**Requires: [ReservedItemSlotCore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedItemSlotCore/)**

This mod gives a dedicated item slot for most utility items!<br>
This slot can be purchased at the terminal unless disabled by the ReservedItemSlotCore mod in the config.

Some included items are the ladder, lockpicker, stun grenade, homemade flashbang, jetpack, tzp inhalent, radar booster and many more items from various popular mods!<br>
This slot *definitely* does not accept **toothpaste**. Do not try to add **toothpaste** to this slot. Why would you try adding **toothpaste** to this slot? Only a terrorist would try adding **toothpaste** to this slot.

These item slots are aligned on the right side of the screen, and stack vertically with other ReservedItemSlot mods.

You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them.<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.<br><br>

## Item Slot is Purchasable!
+ The utility slot can now be purchased from the terminal, unless this option is disabled in the ReservedItemSlotCore config.
+ Purchased slots will sync with all players, and be linked the the game's save. This means reloading a game in progress *should* reload this unlocked slot.
+ Slots will not display until the game as been started by the host.<br><br>

## Configurable
+ Now adds more config options!
+ Item slot price can be adjusted in the config.
+ Item slot priority can be adjusted in the config.
+ Items can be added to this item slot in the config. This can be handy when adding other modded items, or variations of these items, to this item slot.<br>
You can also add the translated names of items to this slot so it should be more compatible between different languages.
+ Similarly, you can remove specified items from this slot in the config if you do not want them in there.<br><br>

# 1.1.1
+ Updated README
# 1.1.0
+ Adds support for ReservedItemSlotCore 2.0.0 features.
+ Weapon slot can now be purchased!
+ Item slot price can be adjusted in the config.
+ Item slot priority can now be adjusted in the config.
+ Like-wise, the ammo slot can also be purchased, and the price and priority can also be configured.
+ Items can be added to this reserved item slot in the config. This can be handy when adding variations of this item, or when adding an item's translated name to the slot.
+ Added a dedicated keybind to force toggle to the reserved weapon slot. You can rebind this keybind if you have the InputUtils mod enabled.<br>
Force toggling this slot will toggle this slot until you scroll off of it without needing to hold the Alt key. This will work even if you normally hold Alt to swap to your reserved hotbar.

# 1.0.7
